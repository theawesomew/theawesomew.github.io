Dearest Makenzi,

I'm not going to lie - I'm extremely curious how you're going to respond to receiving a letter in this form. It's not only sort of unusual but, tragically hosted on my GitHub repository.

But, I would hope that you've come to expect strange shit from me and know that my love for you isn't remotely a secret - and I do not mind express myself on the open platform of the internet.

In any case, all this is really here is to say is Happy Valentine's Day. I love you with every part of me. You are my home; an endless source of happiness, joy, love, and sstrength in my life, and I can't wait to share countless stories, adventures, and memories with you. You are truly an amazing person in an uncountable number of ways and I feel blessed that you're a part of my life.

With all my love,
Will x

## P.S. I'm planning next Valentine's Day
