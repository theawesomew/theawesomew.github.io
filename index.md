Dear Makenzi,

I haven't penned a letter to you in what feels like forever. I don't know why if I'm very honest, I've had so much that I wanted to write to you but, I haven't taken the time to sit down & write one. 

Although making a Markdown document and publishing it to my personal website isn't how I normally do this, I felt a desire to write something out in the domain which comprises most of my life and is culturally my home (yes, i am a nerd - that i don't live in a basement is a miracle) (plus i waste less paper trying to write and rewrite my words).

I love you.

I love you with every fibre of my being - there isn't a bone in my body, a neuron in my brain, or skerrick of my soul which isn't filled with love for you. You are my best friend, my soulmate & my home. Everytime you're nearby, I feel like the luckiest man to ever live; like God has blessed me with a personal angel on Earth. 

To tell you the truth, despite my self-doubt & rampant negative self-talk, you make me feel as though I'm your angel. That I'm loved unconditionally, completely, and including - rather than in spite of - my flaws. I can't thank you enough for that. I can't thank you enough that you make every day feel like a new opportunity to be alive - rather than another day that I have to endure. And I can't thank you enough for letting me be apart of your world.

You're simply the most beautiful person I've ever had the pleasure of meeting; inside & out. Your beautiful smile & mellifluous laughter fills my heart with endless joy & lights up every room you enter. The energy you radiate offers this beautiful, irridescent glow to the world that I cannot help but admire. And everyday that I spend in that glow makes me fall more & more in love with you.

I will be honest in saying that I'm always very unsure when I write these. There's this fear that I've said too much or spoken with too much gravitas. But, if one bites their tongue for too long, they will eventually bite it off. And I would rather be anxious than regretful.

With all my love,
Will xx
