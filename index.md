Dear Makenzi,

Happy Birthday!

I cannot believe I have been around for 3 birthdays already - and I am deeply honoured to have been there for every single one of them (and very lucky to have been at the first one else I may not have been at the rest of them)

You are, without doubt, the most amazing person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. You are so kind, loving, supportive, attentive, empathetic, intelligent, beautiful & compassionate - it truly amazes me.

I am constantly in awe of the way in which you enrich my life and the lives of every single person who has the honour of calling you their friend.

You are my soulmate, my hero, and my best friend - and I am forever grateful to have you in my life.

I love you with absolutely all my heart and I am endlessly proud of you.

Love, Will xx

P.S. I am really sorry not all of your presents arrived on time - they are still on their way

P.P.S. I don't know about you...
